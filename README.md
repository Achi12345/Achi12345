Hi Im Achi, I work in publishing.  I had a lot of discussion on a JOSS for data science.
Something along the lines below. IF anyone has interest to discuss further/get involved to see something like this happen you can reach me on achidosanjh@gmail.com

The aim of this proposed publication is to provide a venue for new research results and the tools, workflows, and novel applications that made the result possible. 
 We need some kind of integration of code/data  with paper and  with the peer review system. 
In a demo area:  Can we treat code as part of paper, where the data/code is downloaded and read and graphics/simulations are run and benchmarks  used to execute the algorithms.
The idea is to use a series of examples (test ) across the software to help evaluate the models..a platform where datasets + code + papers can be housed to enable shared input/outputs, 
that allows Jupyter notebooks and the like to exist but also share full workflows (Docker, ReproZip etc) that can be reused/reproduced.
